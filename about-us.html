            <b>THANATAPATHY</b> is a Baltimore-based 
            literary & media magazine that focuses on <b>BIPOC+ trans and queer voices</b> who have been
            hurt and killed by the bureaucratic thread of all destruction: classism, racism, traffic violence, and
            climate decay that is starkingly parallel to the former two! 
            
        </p>

        <p>

            <b>THANATAPATHY</b>
            brings to light what apathy is: death. Many of us who are 
            victim to traffic violence, climate destruction, and the hegemony of the empire 
            are so not only because of the color of our skin but by our choice to 
            refute a system who so badly wishes for us to assimilate to capitalism.

            Riding a bike is, at its core, an act of protest. Using public transit because of either 
            being unable to afford a car or deciding not to use private transit is both indicative of 
            one's wealth disparity and refusal to submit to the normalization of car use.

            While this press is, in theory, limited and for the production of this project, it has 
            the potential to grow into something more.

            All 
            are welcome to submit, though priority will be given to the underrepresented.

                This journal was made for our CAPSTONE project through the Chesapeake Bay
