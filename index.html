            <b>THANATAPATHY</b> is a Baltimore-based 
            literary & media magazine that focuses on <b>trans, queer, and BIPOC+ voices</b> above all. All 
            are welcome to submit, though priority will be given to the underrepresented.

            For the first issue, 
            we are partnering with <b>Bikemore</b>, a people-focused, public transit, and bicycle advocacy and community non-profit
            here in Baltimore for our editor's CAPSTONE project through the Chesapeake Bay Trust's 
            "Chesapeake Conservation and Climate Corps" (CCCC) program.

            This space is a place for art that rejects complacency, mediums that dissent, go against the 
            status quo, going past what is marked as the appropriate. Are we a political magazine? Are we bipartisan? Nonpartisan?
            For the sake of our editor's commitment to the CCCC, we will say...people should not be 
            preliminarily prescribed as politics! Do with that how you will.
            <b>THANATAPATHY</b> is meant to spark disarray within normalization of cars, murder, and the deaths of children, and more. 
            It will be seen as less than, as detractful, mindless, and, best of all, everchanging. 
            
            </p>

        <div class="box-fill">
        <p>
            <b>THANATAPATHY</b> is an act against 
            individualism, complicity, omission, and refutes subtlety. This is a space for art to spark thoughts that enact discomfort
            for all. Create your voice and show others the change that is necessary to end the deaths of others. Does your art 
            make commentary on the violence of cars and those who use cars? Are cars a part of a greater problem, of taxpayer dollars 
            going towards detraction and death than progress and health? Are cars symbolic? An allusion towards a far more nefarious, 
            poisonous, murderous issue? What are cars to you, and how do they endanger you on your walk across a street, your bicycle 
            commute miles from home? Do cars have a more ironically organic love and focus than actual people, so much so that even 
            buses, trains, metros, and other forms of public transit suffer because of car dependency? Do cars kill the environment? 
            Are electric cars truly a better alternative, or are they another way to feign progress while equally, if not more, 
            contributing to the problem of car dependency and globalization of capital? 
        </p>
        <p>    
            Remember, folks, electric cars are 
            produced en masse just like any other, but an electric bus is made to order. The electic car spreads more tire pollution 
            because of its denser weight due to having several batteries manufactured in laborious and climate-detriment ways, and 
            they will always, always, always maintain the status quo of needing more roads for cars instead of places for people.
